# Neural Extraction Framework @DBpedia

This will be the continuation of my open source project @DBpedia. [here](https://github.com/dbpedia/neural-extraction-framework/tree/main/GSoC24)

### What is Neural Extraction Framework?
[DBpedia](https://www.dbpedia.org/) is a knowledge base constructed by parsing the infoboxes present on wikipedia pages. This knowledge base consists of [relational triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple) extracted using the infoboxes(which are structured information). There can be more information present in the wikipedia article text which needs to be extracted so as to mine hidden relationships between entities(wikipedia articles). 

# Example of a text and its generated semantic triples:

| subject | predicate | object |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Donald Trump  | alumnus  | University of Pennsylvania  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |

| Donald Trump | alumnus | University of Pennsylvania | https://dbpedia.org/resource/Donald_Trump | http://dbpedia.org/ontology/alumni | https://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Pennsylvania |

The aim of this project is to extract all those triples from the wikipedia article text using SOTA NLP methods for entity and relation extraction, entity linking, relationship matching etc. We have been able to successfully create an end-2-end pipeline to extract triples given a wikipedia page.

**This project couldn't be possible without these amazing models, expressing our gratitude!**:
- [Hermes-Llama](https://huggingface.co/models?search=hermes) - Using the LLM for entity-relation extraction
- [GENRE](https://github.com/facebookresearch/GENRE) - For autoregressive entity-linking
### Code structure
All directories contain a `notebooks` directory which has notebooks with exploration/experimentation code for the models and methods used.

### Installations 
Run the command below to install all requirements of the project at once(preferably in a virtual environment).
```
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For downloading models from huggingface, use the commands below.
```
python models.py
wget https://hf.co/NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B-GGUF/resolve/main/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B-Q4_K_M.gguf
```
For faster inference on Nvidia GPU, unisnstall the llama-cpp-library which was previously installed from the requirements.txt and install the llama-cpp-python library that supports cuda
```
!pip uninstall llama-cpp-python
!pip install llama-cpp-python==0.2.90 \
  --extra-index-url https://abetlen.github.io/llama-cpp-python/whl/cu122
```
### Run from command line
You can run the code from the command line with the ability to run it on a single sentence, or a text file or a wikipedia page.
```
python end-2-end-use.py --text "Washinton is a city in the USA. Barack Obama was the president of the United states of America." --v 0 --save_filename "generated_triples.csv"
```
Or to run on a text file,
```
python end-2-end-use.py --text_filepath "joe_biden_abstract.txt" --v 0 --save_filename "triples_from_file.csv"
```

### Future scope
This project has been successful in developing a new technique of entity-relation extraction in the field of knowledge graph, thereby improving the previous end-2-end pipeline for triple extraction. But there is are still room for improvement towards the task of entity linking.
